        <h1>Croissant - history and origin of croissant</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Across various accounts of croissant history, most sources agree that it originates from Austria as the kipferl. Made
        from a yeasted wheat dough, the kipferl is a baked bread roll common in Central Europe. Records state that the kipferl
        has been around as early as the 13th century, but many believe it may be even older. Popular myths attribute its
        invention as a celebration of the Ottoman Empire’s defeat in the Battle of Vienna; the crescent shape represented the
        moon on the Ottoman flag.
        
        “These stories are almost certainly untrue,” Austrian native Chef Jürgen says.
        
        Regardless of the kipferl’s origins, it would migrate to France later in the 19th century.
        
        In another common legend, Marie Antoinette is said to have introduced the kipferl to French court, homesick for foods
        from Austria. While it’s a romantic story, there are no historical records to back up this retelling.</p>
